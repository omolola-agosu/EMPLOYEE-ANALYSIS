## 1. DATA CLEANING
This essential stage should not be disregarded since it is the basis for trustworthy insight.
During the data cleaning process, I verified that every column was in the correct data type and eliminated 89 duplicate entries I discovered.
I added a new column to help me better understand and draw conclusions from the dataset, and I fixed several inconsistencies and looked for misspelt terms.
